"To dual-boot |trueos| with an existing operating system, first make sure "
"there is either a free partition or an area of free space to use. For "
"example, a system running the Windows operating system usually occupies the "
"entire hard drive. The partition with the current operating system needs to "
"shrink to make room to install |trueos|. Shrinking is an operation which "
"retains the current operating system while reducing the size of its "
"partition. This section demonstrates how to create free space within Windows"
