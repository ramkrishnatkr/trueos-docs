Creating Free Space
===================

To dual-boot |trueos| with an existing operating system, first make sure
there is either a free partition or an area of free space to use. For
example, a system running the Windows operating system usually occupies
the entire hard drive. The partition with the current operating system
needs to shrink to make room to install |trueos|. Shrinking is an
operation which retains the current operating system while reducing the
size of its partition. This section demonstrates how to create free
space within Windows 10.

.. warning:: **Before** shrinking a partition, be sure to back up any
   valuable data to an external media such as a removable USB drive!

To shrink the drive, right-click the :guilabel:`Start` menu and click
:guilabel:`Disk Management`. In the example shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <partition1>`, the Windows system has three
partitions: a 450 MB recovery partition, a 237.93 GB data partition, and
a 100 MB system partition.

   Disk Layout in Disk Management

This image shows all three Windows partitions filling the entire disk.
The data partition must be shrunk to create space to install |trueos|.
Right-click the data partition (in this example, the *(C:)* partition),
and select :guilabel:`Shrink Volume`, as shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <partition2>`.

   Shrink Volume Menu Selection

Wait as the volume is queried for available shrink space. The results
are shown in :numref:`Figure %s <shrink1>`.

   Available Shrink Space

Here, 119307 MB of space is available. This is the maximum amount
Windows can shrink this particular partition. Accept that number, or
choose a smaller number for a smaller |trueos| partition.  Click
:guilabel:`Shrink` to begin the shrinking process.  This procedure can
take several minutes to complete. When finished, the newly created free
space is displayed as seen in :numref:`Figure %s <shrink2>`.

.. note:: The minimum requirement for a |trueos| install is 20 GB. It is
   recommended to have 50 GB.

   Disk with Free Space

.. warning:: It is important to **not** choose to install |trueos| into
   any of the three Windows partitions at the :ref:`Disk Selection`
   screen of the installer. It is a good idea to write down the sizes of
   all of the partitions so the free space is recognizable when the
   |trueos| installer displays the current partitions.

.. _Requirements for Dual Booting:

Requirements for Dual Booting
=============================

Dual booting with |trueos| has several requirements:

* An *EFI* or *UEFI* partitioning scheme. |trueos| does not support the
  older MBR partition scheme, opting instead to use
  `rEFInd <http://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/>`_ for managing or booting
  into operating systems. TrueOS still uses the BSD boot loader, as it
  provides native support for ZFS boot environments. Be sure to select
  :guilabel:`Install rEFInd` when installing |trueos| (see
  :ref:`install7`).

* A partition for each operating system. Many operating systems,
  including |trueos|, can only be installed into a primary or *GPT*
  partition. See :ref:`Creating Free Space` for an example of shrinking
  a disk in Windows to allow for dual booting with |trueos|.

* Back up any existing data! It is recommended to store this backup
  on a different computer, removable media such as a USB drive or DVD
  media.

.. _Dual Booting:

Dual Booting
============

A |trueos| installation assumes there is an existing *GPT* or primary
partition for installation. If the computer has only one disk and
|trueos| is the only operating system, it is fine to accept the default
partitioning scheme. However, if |trueos| is to share space with other
operating systems, ensure |trueos| is installed into the correct
partition, or an existing operating system may be overwritten.

.. note:: As adjusting the partitions/spacing on active disks can be a
   complicated and difficult process, it is recommended to partition
   your disk for dual booting before installing any operating systems.

When installing |trueos| onto a computer meant to contain multiple
operating systems, carefully select the **correct** partition in the
:ref:`Disk Selection` screen. On a system containing multiple
partitions, each partition is listed.

.. danger:: Avoid selecting a partition containing an operating system
   or essential data.

Highlight the desired partition and click :guilabel:`Customize`.
Clicking :guilabel:`Next` without customizing the disk layout results
in the installer overwriting the contents of the primary disk.

Once installed, the system boots into the rEFInd menu seen in
:numref:`Figure %s <refind1>`.

   rEFInd Boot Manager

rEFInd displays any installed operating systems and boots into the
default choice after a few seconds. Press any key other than
:kbd:`Enter` to pause automatic booting, then use the arrow keys to
select the desired operating system. Press :kbd:`Enter` to continue
booting.
