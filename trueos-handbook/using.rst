Using |trueos|
**************

This chapter discusses using |trueos| for many common tasks. Because
TrueOS incorporates the |lumina| desktop environment and |sysadm|
system management utility, those projects are used for a variety of
user customization tasks such as theming, user management, and system
backups. As each of these projects have their own documentation, links
to the |lumina| and |sysadm| client handbooks are provided.

.. _Lumina:

|lumina|
========

The Lumina Desktop Environment (|lumina| for short) is a lightweight,
XDG-compliant, BSD-licensed desktop environment focused on streamlining
work efficiency with minimal system overhead. It is specifically
designed for |trueos| and FreeBSD, but has also been ported to many
other BSD and Linux operating systems. It is based on the Qt graphical
toolkit and the Fluxbox window manager, and uses a small number of X
utilities for various tasks, such as :command:`numlockx` and
:command:`xscreensaver`.

|lumina|'s features include:

* Very little system overhead.

* Does not require any of the desktop implementation frameworks such as
  DBUS, policykit, consolekit, systemd, or HALD.

* Provides many :lumbk:`utilities <luminautl.html>` for configuring the
  desktop environment.

* Provides an interface design based on
  :lumbk:`plugins <luminaplugins.html>`. The user can make their desktop
  as light or heavy as they wish by choosing which plugins to have
  running on their desktop and panels. This plugin-based system is
  similar to Android or other modern operating systems.

* A single, easy-to-use
  :lumbk:`Lumina Configuration <luminaconfig.html>` utility controls all
  the different configuration options for the desktop in one location.

* Intelligent *favorites* system for creating quick shortcuts to
  applications, files, and directories.

* ZFS file restore functionality with
  :lumbk:`Insight File Manager <luminautl.html#insight-file-manager>`.

* Multi-monitor support includes the
  :lumbk:`Lumina Xconfig <luminautl.html#xconfig>` graphical utility for
  adding or removing monitors from the |lumina| session.

* Simple :lumbk:`system controls <luminaintro.html#initial-settings>`
  through the system tray for configuring audio volume, screen
  brightness, battery status/notifications, and workspace switching.

* Total system search capabilities through the resource friendly
  :lumbk:`Lumina Search <luminautl.html#lumina-search>` utility.

* Screenshot functionality through
  :lumbk:`Lumina Screenshot <luminautl.html#screenshot>`, which is tied
  to the :kbd:`Print Screen` key by default.

Refer to the `Lumina Handbook <https://lumina-desktop.org/handbook/>`_
for detailed descriptions of every element of |lumina|.

These next sections describe each element of |trueos| that is managed
by |lumina| and provides links to the relevant section of the Lumina
handbook.

.. index:: network manager
.. _Network Manager:

Network Manager
===============

During installation, |trueos| configures any connected Ethernet
interfaces to use DHCP and provides a screen to
:ref:`Connect to a Wireless Network`. In most cases, this means
connected interfaces should "just work" whenever using a |trueos|
system.

After installation, a wireless configuration icon appears in the system
tray if |trueos| detects a supported wireless card. Hover over the
wireless icon shown in :numref:`Figure %s <network1>` to see an
indication if the interface is associated and more information
regarding the IP address, IPv6 address, SSID, connection strength,
connection speed, MAC address, and type of wireless device.

.. _network1:

.. figure:: images/network1.png
   :scale: 100%

   System Tray Wireless Information

If you right-click the wireless icon, a list of detected wireless
networks displays. Click the name of a network to associate with it.
The right-click menu also provides options to configure the wireless
device, start the Network Manager, restart the network (useful to renew
your DHCP address), route the network connection through Tor (to browse
the Internet anonymously as described in :ref:`Tor Mode`), and close the
Network Monitor so the icon no longer shows in the system tray.

To view or manually configure a network interface, click
:guilabel:`Start the Network Manager` within |sysadm| or type
:samp:`sudo pc-netmanager`. If a new device has been inserted, such as a
USB wireless interface, a pop-up message opens when Network
Manager starts. This message indicates the name of the new device and
asks if you want to enable it. Click :guilabel:`Yes` and the new device
is displayed with the list of network interfaces that |trueos|
recognizes. In the example seen in :numref:`Figure %s <network2>`, the
system has one Intel Ethernet interface that uses the **em** driver and
an Intel wireless interface that uses the **wlan** driver.

.. _network2:

   Network Manager

The rest of this section describes each tab of the Network Manager
utility and demonstrates how to view and configure the network settings
for both Ethernet and wireless devices.

.. index:: network devices tab
.. _Network Devices:

Network Devices
---------------

If you highlight an Ethernet interface in the :guilabel:`Devices` tab
and either click :guilabel:`Configure` or double-click the interface
name, the screen shown in :numref:`Figure %s <network3>` appears.

.. _network3:

.. figure:: images/network3.png
   :scale: 100%

   Network Settings for an Ethernet Interface

There are two ways to configure an Ethernet interface:

1. **Use DHCP:** This method assumes your Internet provider or network
   router assigns addressing information automatically using the DHCP
   protocol. Most networks are built in this manner. This method is
   recommended as it should "just work".

2. **Manually type in the IP addressing information:** This method
   requires an understanding of the basics of TCP/IP addressing or
   knowledge of which IP address to use on your network. If you do not
   know which IP address or subnet mask to use, ask your Internet
   provider or network administrator.

By default, |trueos| attempts to obtain an address from a DHCP server.
If you wish to manually type in your IP address, check
:guilabel:`Assign static IP address`. Type in the IP address, using the
right arrow key or the mouse to move between octets. Then, double-check
the subnet mask (**Netmask**) is the correct value. If not, change it
again.

If the Ethernet network uses 802.1x authentication, check
:guilabel:`Enable WPA authentication`, which enable the
:guilabel:`Configure WPA` button. Click this button to select the
network and input the authentication values required by the network.

By default, :guilabel:`Disable this network device` is unchecked. If
this checkbox is filled, |trueos| immediately stops the interface
from using the network. The interface remains inactive until this
checkbox is unchecked.

The :guilabel:`Advanced` tab, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <network4>`,
allows advanced users to manually input a
:wiki:`MAC address <MAC_address>` or
:wiki:`IPv6 address <IPv6_address>`. Both boxes should remain checked in
order to automatically receive these addresses, unless you are an
advanced user with reason to change the default MAC or IPv6 address and
an understanding of how to input an appropriate replacement address.

.. _network4:

.. figure:: images/network4.png
   :scale: 100%

   Ethernet Interface Network Settings - Advanced

The :guilabel:`Info` tab, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <network5>`,
displays the current network address settings and some traffic
statistics.

.. _network5:

   Ethernet Interface Network Settings - Info

If any changes are made within any of the tabs, click :guilabel:`Apply`
to activate them. Click :guilabel:`OK` when finished to return to the
main Network Manager window.

Repeat this procedure for each desired network interface.

.. index:: wireless adapters
.. _Wireless Adapters:

Wireless Adapters
-----------------

If the wireless interface does not automatically associate with a
wireless network, the wireless profile containing the security settings
required by the network will need to be configured. Double-click the
wireless icon in the system tray or highlight the wireless interface
displayed in the :guilabel:`Devices` tab of Network Manager and click
:guilabel:`Configure`. :numref:`Figure %s <network6>` demonstrates this
system's wireless interface is currently associated with the wireless
network listed in the :guilabel:`Configured Network Profiles` section.

.. _network6:

.. figure:: images/network6.png
   :scale: 100%

   Wireless Configuration

To associate with a wireless network, click :guilabel:`Scan` to view a
list of connectable wireless networks. Highlight the desired network to
associate with and click :guilabel:`+Add Selected`. If the network
requires authentication, a pop-up window prompts you for the
authentication details. Input the values required by the network, then
click :guilabel:`Close`. |trueos| then adds an entry for the network in
the :guilabel:`Configured Network Profiles` section.

If the network is hidden, click :guilabel:`+Add Hidden`, input the name
of the network in the pop-up window, and click :guilabel:`OK`.

If multiple networks are added, use the arrow keys to place them in the
desired connection order. |trueos| attempts to connect to networks in
order from first to last in the connection list. When prioritizing
connections, click :guilabel:`Apply`. A pop-up message then indicates
|trueos| is restarting the network. Next, an IP address and status of
**associated** appears when hovering over the wireless icon in the
system tray. If this does not happen, double-check for errors in the
configuration values and read the Troubleshooting section on
:ref:`Network Help`.

|trueos| supports the types of authentication shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <network7>`. Access this screen and change
authentication settings by highlighting an entry in the
:guilabel:`Configured Network Profiles` section and clicking
:guilabel:`Edit`.

.. _network7:

   :scale: 100%

   Configuring Wireless Authentication Settings

This screen provides configuration of different types of wireless
security:

* **Disabled:** If the network is open, no additional configuration is
  required.

* **WEP:** This type of network can be configured to use either a hex
  or a plaintext key and Network Manager will automatically select the
  type of detected key. If :guilabel:`WEP` is pressed, then
  :guilabel:`Configure`, the screen in :numref:`Figure %s <network8>`
  appears. Type the key into both :guilabel:`Network Key` boxes. If
  the key is complex, check :guilabel:`Show Key` to ensure the passwords
  are matching and correct. Uncheck this box when finished to replace
  the characters in the key with bullets. A wireless access point using
  WEP can store up to 4 keys and the number in the :guilabel:`key index`
  indicates which desired key to use.

  .. _network8:

  .. figure:: images/network8.png
     :scale: 100%

     WEP Security Settings

* **WPA Personal:** This type of network uses a plaintext key. If you
  click :guilabel:`WPA Personal` then :guilabel:`Configure`, the screen
  shown in :numref:`Figure %s <network9>` appears. Type in the key twice
  to verify it. If the key is complex, check :guilabel:`Show Key` to
  ensure the passwords match.

  .. _network9:

  .. figure:: images/network9.png
     :scale: 100%

     WPA Personal Security Settings

* **WPA Enterprise:** If you click :guilabel:`WPA Enterprise` then
  :guilabel:`Configure`, the screen shown in
  :numref:`Figure %s <network10>` appears. Select the
  :guilabel:`EAP Authentication Method`, input the EAP identity, browse
  for the CA certificate, client certificate and private key file, and
  input and verify the password.

     :scale: 100%

     WPA Enterprise Security Settings

.. note:: If unsure which type of encryption is being used, ask the
   person who setup the wireless router. They should also be able to
   provide the value of any settings seen in these configuration
   screens.

To disable this wireless interface, check
:guilabel:`Disable this wireless device` in the :guilabel:`General` tab
for the device. This setting is helpful when temporarily preventing the
wireless interface from connecting to untrusted wireless networks.

The :guilabel:`Advanced` tab, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <network11>`,
allows configuring several options:

* **Custom MAC address:** This setting is for advanced users and
  requires :guilabel:`Use hardware default MAC address` to be unchecked.

* **Interface receiving IP address information:** If the network
  contains a DHCP server, check
  :guilabel:`Obtain IP automatically (DHCP)`. Otherwise, input the IP
  address and subnet mask to use on the network.

* **Country code:** This setting is not required if in North America.
  For other countries, check :guilabel:`Set Country Code` and select
  your country from the drop-down menu.

.. index:: Tor
.. _Tor Mode:

Tor Mode
--------

Tor mode uses `Tor <https://www.torproject.org/>`_,
`socat <http://www.dest-unreach.org/socat/>`_, and a built-in script
which automatically creates the necessary firewall rules to enable and
disable Tor mode at the user's request. While in Tor mode, the firewall
redirects all outgoing *port 80* (HTTP), *443* (HTTPS), and DNS traffic
through the Tor transparent proxy network.

To start Tor mode, right-click the network icon in the system tray and
check :guilabel:`Route through TOR`. Enter your password via the pop-up
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <tor1>`. If activated correctly, |trueos|

.. index:: Sysadm
.. _SysAdm:

|sysadm|
========

Beginning with |trueos| 11, most of the system management utilities
previously available in the |pcbsd| Control Panel have been
rewritten to use the |sysadm|
`API <https://api.sysadm.us/getstarted.html>`_. This API is designed to
simplify managing any FreeBSD, |trueos| desktop, or |trueos| server
system over a secure connection from any operating system with the
|sysadm| application installed. |sysadm| is built into |trueos| as the
:guilabel:`SysAdm: Control Panel`.

The |sysadm| `Client Handbook <https://sysadm.us/handbook/client/>`_
is recommended for new |trueos| users, while the
`Server <https://sysadm.us/handbook/server/>`_ and
`API Reference <https://api.sysadm.us/>`_ guides are available for
advanced users.

The rest of this section describes the elements of TrueOS controlled by
SysAdm, providing links to the relevant SysAdm documentation:

When working with files on a |trueos| system, save your files to your
home directory. Since most of the files outside your home directory are
used by the operating system and applications, you should not delete or
modify any files outside of your home directory unless confident in what
you are doing.

:numref:`Table %s <dirstructure>` summarizes the directory structure
found on a |trueos| system. :command:`man hier` explains this directory
structure in more detail.

Service Management in OpenRC
----------------------------

.. index:: openrc runlevels
.. _Runlevels:

Runlevels
^^^^^^^^^

Traditionally, FreeBSD operates in single- and multi-user modes.
However, OpenRC offers the ability to define **runlevels**. An OpenRC
**runlevel** is a grouping of services, nothing more. Any number of
system services can be associated with a given runlevel. In |trueos|,
there are two main preconfigured runlevels: **boot** and **default**.
The **default** runlevel is analogous to the FreeBSD multi-user mode,
and is associated with the *Normal Bootup* option of the |trueos|
bootloader.

.. note:: No OpenRC runlevels are executed if the system is booted into
   single-user mode (see :numref:`Figure %s <boot1>`.)

Runlevels are defined by subdirectories of :file:`/etc/runlevels`; all
associations between services and runlevels can be shown by running
the command:

:samp:`$ rc-update show -v`

OpenRC has a few ordered runlevels in |trueos|. In order of execution:

1. **sysinit**: Used for OpenRC to initialize itself.
2. **boot**: Starts most base services from :file:`/etc/init.d/`.
3. **default**: Services started by ports are added here.

.. note:: Services added by ports cannot be added to *boot* or
   *sysinit*.

OpenRC allows users to add services in the prefix location to the *boot*
runlevel. These services are started before the :file:`/usr` filesystem
is mounted. Finally, there is a *shutdown* runlevel reserved for a few
services like :command:`savecore` or :command:`pc-updatemanager`, which
installs updates at shutdown.

When a service is added to a runlevel, a symlink is created in
:file:`/etc/runlevels`. When a service is started, stopped, or changed
to another state, a symlink is added to :file:`/libexec/rc/init.d/`, as
seen in this example:

.. code-block:: none

 [tmoore@Observer] ~% ls /libexec/rc/init.d/
 daemons exclusive inactive scheduled starting wasinactive
 depconfig failed options softlevel stopping
 deptree hotplugged prefix.lock started tmp

.. index:: services and runlevels
.. _Services and Runlevels:

Services and Runlevels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenRC includes options to *start*, *stop*, *add*, or *delete* services
from runlevels as seen in :numref:`Table %s <rcbootserv>`. Most of these
actions can be accomplished using the
:sysclbk:`Service Manager <service-manager>` built into |sysadm|.
Individuals familiar with the FreeBSD :command:`service` command may
notice some similarities between some of these commands.

.. _Writing OpenRC Services:

Writing OpenRC Services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenRC has a dependency based init system. As an example, examine the
SysAdm service, which needs *network*. Here are the contents of the
:file:`/usr/local/etc/init.d/sysadm` *depend* section:

.. code-block:: none

 depend() {
 need net
 after bootmisc
 keyword -shutdown
 }

SysAdm requires *network* (**need net**), which is the nickname of the
:file:`/etc/init.d/network` service defined by *provide in network*.
SysAdm also starts **after** *bootmisc*. If you don’t want the
restarting *network* to restart SysAdm, then *net* is unnecessary. To
start SysAdm after *network*, then add *network to the actual name of
the script in **after bootmisc**.

Here are the contents of :file:`/etc/init.d/network`:

.. code-block:: none

 depend()
 {
 provide net
 need localmount
 after bootmisc modules
 keyword -jail -prefix -vserver -stop
 }

The *provide* option sets the service nickname to *net*. *Need* means
restarting *localmount* restarts *network*. *After* indicates the
service starts after *bootmisc* and *modules*. For example, the keyword
*-jail* option says this service doesn't run in a jail, prefix, or any
of the other options shown.

There is also a cache directory under :file:`/libexec/rc`. This keeps a
dependencies cache that is only updated when those dependencies change.
Several other directories exist for other binaries and special binaries
used by OpenRC functions.

For more creation options for OpenRC compatible init scripts, type
:samp:`man openrc-run` in a CLI.

RC Defaults
-----------

.. note:: RC Defaults are subject to change during development.

|trueos| and FreeBSD now have very different rc defaults.

**TrueOS OpenRC Defaults**

The entire
`TrueOS rc.conf file <https://github.com/trueos/freebsd/blob/drm-next-4.7/etc/defaults/rc.conf>`_
is viewable on GitHub.

.. code-block:: none

 # Global OpenRC configuration settings

 # Set to "YES" if you want the rc system to try and start services
 # in parallel for a slight speed improvement. When running in parallel
 # we prefix the service output with its name as the output will get
 # jumbled up.
 # WARNING: whilst we have improved parallel, it can still potentially
 # lock the boot process. Don't file bugs about this unless you can
 # supply patches that fix it without breaking other things!
 #rc_parallel="NO"

 # Set rc_interactive to "YES" and you'll be able to press the I key
 # during boot so you can choose to start specific services. Set to "NO"
 # to disable this feature. This feature is automatically disabled if
 # rc_parallel is set to YES.
 #rc_interactive="YES"

 # If we need to drop to a shell, you can specify it here.
 # If not specified we use $SHELL, otherwise the one specified in
 # /etc/psswd, otherwise /bin/sh

**FreeBSD RC Defaults**

The entire
`FreeBSD rc.conf file <https://github.com/freebsd/freebsd/blob/master/etc/defaults/rc.conf>`_
is available online.

.. code-block:: none

 #!/bin/sh

 # This is rc.conf - a file full of useful variables that you can set
 # to change the default startup behavior of your system.  You should
 # not edit this file!  Put any overrides into one of the
 # ${rc_conf_files} instead and you will be able to update these
 # defaults later without spamming your local configuration information.
 #
 # The ${rc_conf_files} files should only contain values which override
 # values set in this file.  This eases the upgrade path when defaults
 # are changed and new features are added.
 #
 # All arguments must be in double or single quotes.
 #
 # For a more detailed explanation of all the rc.conf variables, please
 # refer to the rc.conf(5) manual page.

 ##############################################################

The |trueos| :file:`rc.conf` file is smaller because :file:`rc.conf` is
now primarily used for tuning OpenRC behavior. By default, |trueos| uses
3 elements, documented in :numref:`Table %s <orcpritun>`.

:numref:`Table %s <rcuprnlvl>` lists services and their default
runlevels in |trueos|.

OpenRC Install Scripts
----------------------

There are number of scripts used for older |trueos| systems and new
installations. These are listed below.

.. index:: onetime migration
.. _One time migration:

One-time Migration Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A one time migration script is available for |trueos| installations
dated 10-28-16 or older still using the legacy FreeBSD *rc* system:

.. note:: This block is truncated from the
   `original file <https://github.com/trueos/trueos-core/blob/master/xtrafiles/local/bin/migrate_rc_openrc>`_

.. code-block:: none

 #!/bin/sh

 if [ ! -e /etc/rc.conf ] ; then
   exit 0
 fi

 . /etc/rc.conf

 for var in `set | grep "_enable="`
 do
   key=`echo $var | cut -d '=' -f 1 | sed 's|_enable||g'`
   val=`echo $var | cut -d '=' -f 2`
   if [ "$val" != "YES" ] && [ "$val" != "NO" ] ; then continue; fi
   if [ "$val" = "NO" ] && [ -e "/etc/runlevels/default/$key" ] ; then
       echo "Deleting OpenRC service for $key to default runlevel..."
       rc-update delete $key default
   fi
   if [ -e "/etc/init.d/$key" -o -e "/usr/local/etc/init.d/$key" ] ; then
     if [ -e "/etc/runlevels/default/$key" ] ; then
       echo "OpenRC service for $key already enabled, skipping.."

With this migration, :file:`rc.conf.trueos`, located in :file:`/etc/`,
has been phased out of |trueos| and is automatically removed from legacy
installs dated 10-28-16 and older by :command:`pc-updatemanger`:

This script defines a list of services such as *PCDM* designated to boot
by default on a desktop. It also defines what drivers to load on a
desktop. This is now accomplished when the *trueos-desktop* or
*trueos-server* package is installed using :command:`sysrc` or other
methods. Now there is no need to keep an extra overlay file to
accomplish this behaviour.

.. index:: desktop pkginstall script
.. _TrueOS desktop pkginstall script:

|trueos| Desktop pkg-install Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

   :file:`pkg-install` file, available online:

The typical :command:`nginx_enable=”YES”` is no longer used to enable
services. Instead, :command:`rc-update` adds or deletes services from
runlevels. The one time migration script automatically adds previously
defined user services to the OpenRC default runlevel. Leftover lines can
be removed after migration.

.. index:: update port makefile
.. _Update Port Makefile:

Updating a Port's Makefile
--------------------------

There are many required updates to adjust each port's :file:`Makefile`
to the new format, **USE_OPENRC_SUBR=**. However, these are to be
changed only when each service file has the new OpenRC ready format:

.. note:: This is an excerpt from the |trueos| :file:`openrc-dbus.in`
   file, which is available on the |trueos|
   `freebsd-ports GitHub repository <https://github.com/trueos/freebsd-ports/blob/trueos-master/devel/dbus/files/openrc-dbus.in>`_

Several developers are working on the thousands of instances as quickly
as possible. Anyone can begin transitioning to defining all service
configurations in :file:`/etc/conf.d/`, if desired. All configuration
files should reside in that directory with the name of the service for
the configuration file itself. For example, *nginx* is
:file:`/etc/conf.d/nginx`.

Generally, usage of :file:`/etc/rc.conf` is minimized. Tweaking the
default OpenRC configuration parameters is recommended only for advanced
users. It is still possible to use service configurations through
:file:`/etc/rc.conf`, but this file is unusable for enabling or
disabling services for startup.

.. index:: Flash
.. _Flash plugin:

Flash Plugin
============

|trueos| supports using a Flash plugin for those browsers/applications
that use Flash. To begin using this plugin, search for and install
"linux-flashplayer" using |appcafe|. Alternately, type
:samp:`[samp@examp] ~% sudo pkg install linux-flashplayer` in a command
line and enter the root password when requested.

The "nspluginwrapper" is also required when using Flash. Install it
with |appcafe| or by typing
:samp:`[samp@examp] ~% sudo pkg install nspluginwrapper` in a command
line.

Once *linux-flashplayer* and *nspluginwrapper* are installed, configure
them by opening a command line and typing this command:

.. code-block:: none

 % nspluginwrapper -v -a -i

In this example, Flash is configured and ready for use with the Firefox
browser. To confirm Flash is usable, open Firefox and type
**about:plugins** in the address bar. An *Installed plugins* page
displays, listing *Shockwave Flash* an installed plugin. See
:numref:`Figure %s <flash1>` as an example of Firefox with Flash
installed.

.. index:: usb automounter
.. _Automounter:

Automounter
===========

.. tip:: The *Mount Tray* has been replaced by the new **Automounter**.

The automounter, based on the :command:`devd` and :command:`automount`
utilities, facilitates mounting and unmounting USB storage devices and
optical media. It also conforms to an **XDG** standard to allow the
addition of new features. The automounter is part of the default
|trueos| installation, but is generally invisible until a new device is
attached to the system.

Currently, the automounter ignores internal hard drives (sata, ide) and
networking shares. It does support many different filesystems:

* cd9660

* exFAT (Requires :file:`mount.exfat-fuse`. Possible intermittent
  detection issues.)

* ext2

* ext4 (Requires :file:`ext4fuse`)

* FAT32

* MSDOSFS

* MTPfs (Requires :file:`simple-mtpfs`)

* NTFS (Requires :file:`ntfs-3g`)

   :numref:`Table %s <filesys support>` for more details.

To engage the automounter, attach a USB storage device or insert optical
media to the system. The automounter detects the device by ID and adds
icons to the desktop, as seen in :numref:`Figure %s <automnt1>`:

.. _automnt1:

.. figure:: images/automnt1.png
   :scale: 65%

   USB icons added to desktop via the automounter. Hovering over the
   icon displays the actual device name and filesystem type.

.. tip:: The appearance of these icons do **not** mean the device is
   mounted. Devices are only mounted when the user begins to interact
   with the device.

Either navigating to a device or beginning copy operations mounts the
device. The device is unmounted by the **autounmountd** service after
the user navigates away and/or file copy operations stop.

For example, the above image shows USB drive "FreeNAS" attached to
the system. After double-clicking the desktop icon,
"Insight File Manager" opens to the device's location,
:file:`autofs/da0`. While :guilabel:`Insight` opens, the automounter
mounts the device. After closing :guilabel:`Insight`, the device is also
unmounted and safe to remove from the system.

In the CLI, the automounter adds a :file:`.desktop` file to
:file:`/media` when a new USB/Optical device is added. Open the
:file:`.desktop` file with :command:`xdg-open` or
:command:`lumina-open`. When the device is removed, the symlink is
immediately removed from :file:`/media`.

.. note:: The :file:`/.autofs/*` directories are not cleaned when the
   device is removed. However, after device removal the directories are
   no longer associated with the device in the backend. For this reason,
   :file:`/media` is more useful to identify which devices are attached
   to the system.

Alternately, all device names are added to the :file:`/.autofs`
directory. Attached devices are also accessed by navigating to
:file:`/.autofs/<devicename>`.

Known limitations:

* UFS permissions. These permissions are preserved on USB media. To
  allow multiple users access to files from a UFS stick, those files'
  permissions need to be set to *read/write by any user* (777).

* ZFS pools are not yet supported. This is under investigation to
  ascertain if it can ever work with :command:`automount`.

* Optical Media links are not yet created on the desktop. Optical media
  is accessible by navigating to :file:`/.autofs`.

* Any file system with limited FreeBSD support (HFS or EXT) remain at
  the same level of limited support.

* exFAT detection issues are being investigated.

Coming soon:

* Optical media support for the desktop

* Android device support

* Possible support for ZFS pools

.. index:: Freebsd ports
.. _FreeBSD Ports:

FreeBSD Ports
=============

TrueOS allows users to build applications using the ports system. Use :command:`git` to fetch the FreeBSD ports tree on the local system. It is recommended that users make use of the |trueos| branch of the FreeBSD ports, which is regularly updated against the base FreeBSD ports tree.

.. note:: These commands must be run as the superuser or **root**.

To fetch the ports for the first time, use the following command:

:samp:`# git clone http://github.com/trueos/freebsd-ports.git /usr/ports`

To update an existing local ports directory:

.. code-block:: none

 # cd /usr/ports
 # git pull
 
 The easiest way to find the location of the port you want to build is to browse the TrueOS ports on GitHub: https://github.com/trueos/freebsd-ports. From there, navigate to the directory of the required application and start build process.
 
 For example, to build Filezilla:
 
.. code-block:: none

 # cd /usr/ports/ftp/filezilla
 # make install
 
 

.. index:: printing, scanning
.. _Printing:

Printing and Scanning
=====================

Like many open source operating systems, |trueos| uses the Common Unix
Printing System (`CUPS <https://www.cups.org/>`_) to manage printing.

CUPS provides an easy-to-use utility for adding and managing printers.
Whether or not it automatically detects a printer depends upon how well
the printer is supported by an open source print driver. This section
walks you through a sample configuration for a HP DeskJet 36xx series
printer. Your specific printer may "just work", which simplifies this
process immensely. If your printer configuration does not work, read
this section more closely for ideas on locating correct drivers for your
printer.

.. index:: researching your printer
.. _Researching Your Printer:

Researching your Printer
------------------------

Before configuring your printer, see if a driver already exists for your
particular model, and if so, which driver is recommended. If you are
planning to purchase a printer, this is definitely good information to
know beforehand. Look up the vendor and model of the printer in the
`Open Printing Database <http://www.openprinting.org/printers>`_, which
indicates if the model is supported and if there are any known caveats
with the print driver. Once the model is selected, click
:guilabel:`Show this printer` to see the results.

For the HP DeskJet model example, the HPLIP driver is recommended. In
|trueos|, the HPLIP driver is available as an optional package called
*hplip*. Use |appcafe| to search if the driver is installed, and install
it if not.

.. index:: adding a printer
.. _Adding a Printer:

Adding a Printer
----------------

Once printer support is determined, ensure the printer is plugged into
your computer or, if the printer is a network printer, both your
computer and the printer are connected to the network. Then, open a web
browser and enter the address :command:`127.0.0.1:631/admin`. This opens
the CUPS configuration, shown in :numref:`Figure %s <print4>`.

.. _print4:

.. figure:: images/print4a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Printer Configuration

To add a new printer, click :guilabel:`Add Printer`. CUPS will pause
for a few seconds as it searches for available printers. When finished,
a screen similar to :numref:`Figure %s <print5>` is shown.

.. _print5:

.. figure:: images/print5a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Print Device Selection

In this example, the wizard has found the HP DeskJet 3630 printer on
both the USB port (first entry) and the wireless network (second entry).
Click the desired connection method then click :guilabel:`Continue`.
CUPS then attempts to load the correct driver for the device. If
successful, a screen shown in :numref:`Figure %s <print6>` is shown.

.. _print6:

.. figure:: images/print6a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Describe Printer

This screen automatically fills out the printer model series, a
description, and the type of connection. If desired, add a descriptive
:guilabel:`Location`. If sharing the printer on a network, check
:guilabel:`Sharing`.

Once you click :guilabel:`Continue`, the next screen, shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <print7>`, displays a summary of the selected options
and offers the ability to select another driver. For now, leave the
detected driver and click :guilabel:`Add Printer`. If the printer does
not work using the default driver, read the Troubleshooting
:ref:`Printer Help` section, which describes how to use this screen in
more detail.

.. _print7:

.. figure:: images/print7a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Viewing the Default Driver

The next screen, shown in :numref:`Figure %s <print8>`, can be used to
modify the properties of the printer.

.. _print8:

.. figure:: images/print8a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Modify Print Properties

It is recommended to take a few minutes to review the settings in the
:guilabel:`General`, :guilabel:`Banners`, and :guilabel:`Policies` tabs,
as these allow configuration options such as print banners, permissions,
the default paper size, and double-sided printing. The available
settings can vary depending on the capabilities of the print driver.
When finished, click :guilabel:`Set Default Options` to save the
options. This opens the :guilabel:`Printers` tab with the new printer
displayed. An example is shown in :numref:`Figure %s <print9>`.

.. _print9:

.. figure:: images/print9a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Manage Printer

Print a test page to ensure the printer is working. Verify the printer
has paper and click :menuselection:`Maintenance -> Print Test Page`. If
a test page does not print, refer to the :ref:`Printer Help` of this
handbook.

.. index:: manually adding printer drivers
.. _Manually Adding a Driver:

Manually Adding a Driver
------------------------

If the print configuration fails, double-check the printer is supported
as described in :ref:`Researching your Printer` and HPLIP is installed
if it is a HP printer. Also check the printer is plugged in and powered
on.

If the wizard is unable to even detect the device, try to manually add
the information for the print device. In the :guilabel:`Select Device`
screen (:ref:`print5`), select the type of connection to the printer and
input all necessary information. The type of information depends upon
the type of connection:

**USB:** This entry only appears if a printer is plugged into a USB port
and the number of entries vary depending on the number of USB ports on
the system. If there are multiple USB entries, highlight the one
representing the USB port your printer is plugged into.

**IPP:** Select this option if connecting to a printer cabled to another
computer (typically running a Microsoft operating system) sharing the
printer using IPP. Input the IP address of the printer and the name of
the print queue. To use IPP over an encrypted connection, select "ipps"
instead.

**HTTP:** This option allows you to manually type in the URI to the
printer. A list of possible URIs is available on the
`CUPS site <https://www.cups.org/doc/network.html>`_. To use HTTP
over an encrypted connection, select :guilabel:`https` instead.

**AppSocket/HP JetDirect:** Select this option if connecting to an HP
network printer. Input the IP address of the printer. Only change the
port number if the printer is using a port other than the default of
*9100*.

**LPD/LPR:** Select this option if connecting to a printer which is
cabled to a Unix computer using LPD to share the printer. Input the
hostname and queue name of the Unix system.

After inputting the connection information, continue to add the printer
and test the connection by printing a test page as described in
:ref:`Adding a Printer`.

If the default driver is not working, try re-adding the printer. At the
:ref:`print7` screen, try selecting a different driver.

Alternately, if you have a PPD driver from the manufacturer's website
or on the CD packed in with the printer, click :guilabel:`Choose File`
to browse to the location of the PPD file. PPD (PostScript Printer
Description) is a driver created by the manufacturer ending in a
:file:`.ppd` extension. Sometimes the file ends with a :file:`.ppd.gz`
extension, indicating it is compressed.

.. index:: scanners
.. _Scanner:

Scanning
--------

While no scanning applications are included with |trueos|, there are a
few options available via |appcafe|. One good option is
`XSane <http://www.xsane.org/>`_, a graphical utility for managing
scanners. The rest of this section describes using *XSane* for scanning.

To use your scanner, make sure the device is plugged into the |trueos|
system and click :menuselection:`Browse Applications --> Scanner` or
type :command:`xsane` from the command line. A pop-up message indicates
XSane is detecting devices and prompts you to accept the
XSane license if a device is detected. If a device is not detected,
search for your device at the list of
`supported scanners <http://www.sane-project.org/sane-backends.html>`_.

.. note:: If the scanner is part of an HP All-in-One device, make sure
   the "hplip" package is installed. Use |appcafe| to see if the driver
   is installed, and install it if not.

:numref:`Figure %s <sane1>` shows the XSane interface running on a
|trueos| system attached to an HP DeskJet Printer/Scanner.

.. _sane1:

.. figure:: images/sane1.png
   :scale: 100%

   XSane Interface

The
`XSane documentation <http://www.xsane.org/doc/sane-xsane-doc.html>`_
contains details on how to perform common tasks such as saving an image
to a file, photocopying an image, and creating a fax. It also describes
all of the icons in the interface and how to use them.

By default, XSane uses the default browser when clicking :kbd:`F1` to
access its built-in documentation. Configuring the default browser
varies by window manager so an Internet search may be necessary to set
the default browser setting.

.. index:: fonts
.. _Fonts:

Fonts
=====

|trueos| installs with `Google Noto <http://www.google.com/get/noto/>`_
which provides multi-lingual Sans and Serif fonts. Many other fonts are
available from |appcafe|. Typically, fonts installed using |appcafe| do
not require any additional configuration to "just work".

If you have downloaded or purchased a collection of font, |trueos| can
be configured to also use those fonts. Become the superuser and copy
the downloaded font to the :file:`/usr/local/share/fonts/` directory.
Then, run :samp:`fc-cache -f -v /usr/local/share/fonts/name_of_font`
to refresh the fonts cache.

.. index:: sound mixer tray
.. _Sound Mixer Tray:

Sound Mixer Tray
================

|trueos| includes a graphical utility for managing the sound card's
mixer settings. The utility is accessed by clicking the
:guilabel:`speaker` icon in the system tray.

:numref:`Figure %s <sound1>` shows an example of highlighting the
:guilabel:`Output` option after opening the Sound Mixer. If the
system has one audio output, the :guilabel:`Output` submenu is not
displayed. Clicking an option in this submenu does not set the default
audio device. It only changes it to the selected output for the
current session. The next reboot reverts audio output back to the
default.

.. _sound1:

   Output Options

:numref:`Figure %s <sound2>` shows the :guilabel:`Mixer` menu:

.. _sound2:

.. figure:: images/sound2.png
   :scale: 100%

   Mixer Controls

The :guilabel:`Mixer Controls` screen provides sliders to modify the
left and right channels that control volume, pcm (the sound driver),
the speaker, the microphone, the recording level, the input level, and
the output level. Each control can be muted or unmuted by clicking
:guilabel:`Mute` or :guilabel:`Unmute`, depending on its current mute
state.

:numref:`Figure %s <sound3>` shows the :guilabel:`System Configuration`
tab of the :guilabel:`Mixer`.

.. _sound3:

.. figure:: images/sound3a.png
   :scale: 100%

   System Sound Configuration

This tab contains several options:

* **Recording Device:** Use the drop-down menu to select the device to
  use for recording sound.

* **Default Tray Device:** Use the drop-down menu to set the default
  slider to display in the system tray.

* **Audio Output Channel:** Use the drop-down menu to change the sound
  device and use :guilabel:`Test` to determine if sound is working.
  This is sometimes necessary when changing audio devices. For example,
  when connecting a USB headset, |trueos| detects the new device and
  automatically changes the audio device to the USB input. However, when
  inserting a headset into an audio jack, the system may not detect this
  new input, meaning the default device has changed manually.
  :guilabel:`Set as Default` sets the currently selected audio output
  channel as the system default.

The :guilabel:`Disable PulseAudio` disables all PulseAudio support.

The :guilabel:`File` menu can be used to quit this mixer screen or to
close both this screen and remove the icon from the system tray.

.. note:: To re-add the mixer icon after removing it,
   type :samp:`pc-mixer &` in a command line. Alternately, open this
   application without adding it back to the system tray by typing
   :samp:`pc-mixer -notray`.

|trueos| provides full
`PulseAudio <https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio/>`_
support, which can be configured using the :guilabel:`Configuration`
menu in the :guilabel:`Mixer`. There are options for accessing the
:guilabel:`PulseAudio Mixer` and :guilabel:`PulseAudio Settings`, as
well as an option for restarting PulseAudio. These utilities can be
used to configure discoverable network sound devices and mixer levels.

.. index:: multimedia
.. _Multimedia:

Multimedia
==========

|trueos| is pre-configured to support most multimedia formats and makes
it easy to install most open source media applications using |appcafe|.

After installing a web browser, most media formats become playable,
including YouTube™ videos, Internet radio, and many trailer and movie
sites. When encountering a file unplayable in a web browser or media
player, it is likely in a proprietary format which requires a
licensing fee or restricts distribution of the codec required to play
the media format.

.. note:: When troubleshooting Java™ or Flash® for your browser, please
   refer to the
   `FreeBSD browser <https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/desktop-browsers.html>`_
   documentation, which has more complete instructions for installing
   Java™ and Flash® plugins with specific browsers.

|appcafe| contains several dozen applications for playing and editing
multimedia. It includes these popular applications:

* `aTunes <http://www.atunes.org/?page_id=5>`_: Full-featured audio
  player and manager which can play mp3, ogg, wma, wav, flac, mp4 and
  radio streaming, allowing users to easily edit tags, organize music
  and rip audio CDs.

Windows Emulation
=================

`Wine <https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page>`_ is an application which
allows the creation of a Windows environment for installing Windows
software. This can be useful if your favorite Windows game or
productivity application has not yet been ported to Linux or BSD.

Wine is not guaranteed to work with every Windows application. You can
search for desired applications in the :guilabel:`Browse Apps` section
of the `Wine application database <https://appdb.winehq.org/>`_. The
`Wine wiki <https://wiki.winehq.org/Main_Page>`_ contains resources to
get started and troubleshooting reference material if problems are
encountered with a Windows application.

Wine can be installed using |appcafe|. After installing, it can be
started by typing :command:`winecfg` in the command line. The first time
running this utility, it may prompt to install additional required
packages. If prompted, click :guilabel:`Install` in the pop-up menu.

The initial Wine configuration menu is shown in
:numref:`Figure %s <wine1>`.

.. _wine1:

.. figure:: images/wine1a.png
   :scale: 100%

   Wine Configuration Menu

Click :guilabel:`Add application` to browse to the application's
installer file. By default, the contents of the hard drive will be
listed under *drive_c*. If the installer is on a CD/DVD, use the
drop-down menu to browse to the
:menuselection:`home directory --> *.wine --> dosdevices` folder. The
contents of the CD/DVD should be listed under *d:*. If they are not,
the most likely reason is your CD/DVD was not automatically mounted by
the desktop. To mount the media, type
:samp:`mount -t cd9660 /dev/cd0 /cdrom` as the superuser.

The system then accesses the media and you can now select the installer
file. Once selected, click :guilabel:`Apply` then :guilabel:`OK` to exit
the configuration utility.

To install the application, type :command:`winefile` to see the screen
shown in :numref:`Figure %s <wine2>`.

.. _wine2:

   Installing the Application Using :command:`winefile`

Click the button representing the drive which contains the installer and
double-click on the installation file (e.g. :file:`setup.exe`). The
installer then launches to allow installing the application as on a
Windows system.

.. note:: You may need need to unmount a CD/DVD before it ejects. As the
   superuser, type :samp:`umount /mnt`.

Once the installation is complete, browse to the application's location.

.. index:: Updating TrueOS
.. _Updating TrueOS:

Updating TrueOS
===============

The TrueOS project is organized around two update tracks: STABLE and
UNSTABLE. Updating is handled through the |sysadm| Update Manager; refer
to the SysAdm :sysclbk:`Update Manager <update-manager>` documentation
for more details about using the Update Manager. This section only
contains simple instructions to switch between update tracks.

To view or adjust the current update track for TrueOS, click
:menuselection:`Start Menu --> Control Panel --> Update Manager --> Settings`.
The :guilabel:`Settings` tab, seen in :numref:`Figure %s <update1>`,
allows you to adjust *when* and *where* to perform system updates.

.. _update1:

.. figure:: images/update1.png
   :scale: 100%

   Update Manager Settings

While both STABLE and UNSTABLE tracks are rolling releases based on
FreeBSD-CURRENT, there are a few key differences between them.

.. warning:: Users with UNSTABLE installed before 7/14/2017 need to run
   :command:`pc-updatemanager syncconf` in a command line in order to
   switch to the new UNSTABLE repository added on that day. Alternately,
   switch from UNSTABLE to STABLE in the Update Manager and click
   :guilabel:`Save`. Then, switch back to UNSTABLE and click
   :guilabel:`Save` again.

.. index:: TrueOS STABLE updates
.. _TrueOS STABLE:

TrueOS STABLE
-------------

As its name implies, STABLE refers to the more solid version of TrueOS.
STABLE updates are released infrequently, but are much more tested
and polished. All TrueOS installation files are created from the
STABLE track, and fresh TrueOS installations only look to the STABLE
track for updates.

The STABLE track is recommended for those users who want a more
predictable experience with fewer regressions, and are willing to
wait longer for bugfixes and new utilities or ports.

.. index:: TrueOS UNSTABLE updates
.. _TrueOS UNSTABLE:

TrueOS UNSTABLE
---------------

The UNSTABLE track is the bleeding edge of TrueOS development.
Experimental fixes, upstream patches from the FreeBSD project,
and testing new utilities and applications all happen first with
the UNSTABLE track.

UNSTABLE is recommended for power users, those with custom hardware
unsupported with STABLE, and project contributors who wish to help
test patches committed to TrueOS and/or FreeBSD-CURRENT.

To switch to the UNSTABLE track, open the SysAdm Update Manager and
navigate to the *Settings* tab, seen in :ref:`update1`. Check
:guilabel:`UNSTABLE Repository`, then click :guilabel:`Save Settings`.

Alternately, you can edit :file:`/usr/local/etc/trueos.conf` to change
update tracks without using SysAdm. Here is an example
:file:`trueos.conf`:

.. code-block:: none

 # TrueOS Configuration Defaults

 # Default package set to pull updates from
 PACKAGE_SET: <STABLE, UNSTABLE, or CUSTOM>
 PACKAGE_URL: <CUSTOM url>

 # Default type of CDN to use
 # IPFS - Use IPFS
 # HTTP - Use a standard HTTP connection (default)
 # CDN_TYPE: HTTP

 # Set the number of automatic boot-environments to create / keep
 MAXBE: 5
 AUTO_UPDATE: disabled
 AUTO_UPDATE_REBOOT: disabled

Rolling back from UNSTABLE to STABLE is done by switching tracks back
to the STABLE branch, checking for updates, and rebooting once the
previous STABLE update is installed.
